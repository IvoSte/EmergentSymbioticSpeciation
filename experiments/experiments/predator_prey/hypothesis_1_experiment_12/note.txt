NOTE: 
        Test if we can have stable multiple species over time, with and without evolutionary sampling, with and without nn mate selection.
        This test nr 5 uses strict evolution parameters, ramping up the pressure, in the hopes of achieving more stable/consistent/less ambigious results.
        Testing progeresively more eps value for dbscan, and changing the evolutionary params a bit. Move from really strict to lenient.
        Goal is to find a parameter where we get multiple stable species for ev sampling and nn, and single species for random sampling and fp mate selection.
        Back to the original parameters already..
