NOTE: 
        Objective: What is wrong with only collective fitness without fitness scaling?
        Result: Benchmark, species composition, species fitness
        Variables: cfw, fitness scaling
        Note: Late experiment, to definitively test and see why collective fitness alone does not work in the speciation model.
        9 to run it again, same settings, fewer configs, couple times, for some examplary results.
