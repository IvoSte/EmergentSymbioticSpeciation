NOTE: 
        Test if we can have stable multiple species over time, with and without evolutionary sampling, with and without nn mate selection.
        This test nr 5 uses strict evolution parameters, ramping up the pressure, in the hopes of achieving more stable/consistent/less ambigious results.
