NOTE: 
        Objective: Show the effects of fitness scaling and other collective fitness metrics.
        Result: |Average fitness, fitness per species|, |species per composition, species per generation, species representation|, |Toxin concentration|
        Variables: Sampling (evolutionary vs random), cfw (0, 1), fitness scaling (t,f), cf type (toxin remainder, average)
        Note: These are the first 'core results' showed to Grossi. Very short, deterministic, clear results that exhibit the game theory dynamics.
                Attempt 2 with lower evolutionary parameters. So the change is slower.
