NOTE: 
        Test if individuals form a complete solution, where each species serves as a subcomponent.
        Show toxin levels, gene redundancy, and species composition.
        Experiment with fitness scaling and alignment.
        Higher toxin cost so there should be some movement from initialization.
        Compare different collective fitness types. New fitness type: remainder_and_average.
