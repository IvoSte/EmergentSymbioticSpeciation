DATE CREATED: 2023-12-04 14:13:44.458130
NOTE: 
        Objective: Can a bqh effect be induced?
        Result: |species per composition, species per generation, species representation|, |Toxin Concentration|
        Variables: Sampling (evolutionary vs random), fitness scaling (t,f), cf type average
        Note: These are the first 'core results' showed to Grossi. Very short, deterministic, clear results that exhibit the game theory dynamics.
                Attempt 5 with few generations and many runs, for good averaging.
