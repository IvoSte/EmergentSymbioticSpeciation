DATE CREATED: 2023-11-30 13:25:28.135172
NOTE: 
        Objective: Can a bqh effect be induced?
        Result: |species per composition, species per generation, species representation|, |Toxin Concentration|
        Variables: Sampling (evolutionary vs random), fitness scaling (t,f), cf type average
        Note: These are the first 'core results' showed to Grossi. Very short, deterministic, clear results that exhibit the game theory dynamics.
                Attempt 4 with very few generations, for a zoomed in look, and a smaller population size.
